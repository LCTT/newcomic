- ... So as a Cloud consultant, I can tell you that we can migrate all of your systems to our cloud!
- I don't know Jackson, We have some very peculiar systems.
- I understand , but our cloud provide a wide range of machines and services. we have everything!
- Let me tell you about our inventory System. It runs in a unique server and we don't know why. It only works if...
- ... the machine has a stapler on it and is supported by a giant mild soap bar
- But...This...Does...Not...
- Besides that, The inventory module only works after clicking the stapler.
- But relax, It doesn't need a staples pin!
- Well... Let me check if we have a stapler-as-a-service in our backlog roadmap or something simllar...
- Oh wait, First let me tell you about our finance system.
- To be continued.
