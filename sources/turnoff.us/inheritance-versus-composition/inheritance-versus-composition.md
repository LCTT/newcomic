Inheritance versus Composition
===============

![Inheritance versus Composition](http://turnoff.us/image/en/cokorange.png)

- Inheritance versus composition:
- the case of the cokorange machine
- As a baseline, we used refreshment machine with two functionalities:
- To Serve Orange Juice 
- To Serve Coke
- Inheritance
- The preexisting functionalities are kept.
- A new functionality is added by extension:Cokorange juice.
- Composition
- The Preexisting functionalities are still there,but they're hidden(Encapsulated).
- Cokorange juice is the only functionality available,even though it's a byproduct of the two hidden functionalities.
