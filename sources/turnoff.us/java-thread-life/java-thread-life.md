![Java Thread Life](http://turnoff.us/image/en/thread-life.png)

- ... So , I'm tired of this HTTP thread life. I'm Thinking about looking for something bigger, like EJB threads.
- Why now? Life is so much simpler as an HTTP thread...
- They have those huge, complex stacks and it's more responsibilit,But It's a bigger paycheck,too...
- Yeah,EJB Containers used to be a great place ... I remember it back in the day: transactions,security. It was a 5-star hotel for distributed components.
- Nowadays,Though... They use those Micro-services. And what about the protocol they use for integration? HTTP!
- If i were you, I'd keep working with HTTPThreads,Because There are more Job opportunities around. The old RMI is in its death bed.
- WELL , I was just thinking about the future, you know ? Next Month, Sarah will make a fork.
- That's great news,Man!Congratulations!I didn't Know the family was getting bigger!
- Good morning coy!
- Good morning,gentlemen. This way to the pool.
- ... After Jane made a fork, I've been working overtime to keep up with it all!
- Thread Pool
- Hey coy, Do you have any contacts at Wildfly?
